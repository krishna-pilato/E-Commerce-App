# E-Commerce-App
"**Digital storefront like Amazon or Ebay, but with my own design and code**"

The project started on November 9, 2022 with the aim of practicing a rather complicated personal project. In the following days this README will be updated with more details. Anyone can use that code for anything,, but I'd like to be mentioned. Many things are still to be done, but I want to carry out the project calmly in my free time so that a good result comes out.

**What have I already implemented?**

1. Response from the back-end service (see below image): the security part, login and a test REST Controller have already been implemented. If you try to access via the URL *localhost:8080* you will see that page. I used Java 19.0.1, Spring Boot v3.0.0-SNAPSHOT and MySQL Server 8.0.31 for the backend.

2. The navbar, the main section and the footer have been inserted on the frontend (Angular). The frontend is fully responsive. I used Angular 14.2.9, Boostrap 5.2.2 and FontAwesome 5.15.4 for the frontend.
